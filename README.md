# rluaterm

This is a small project intended to just be a way of helping me learn a bit more about Rust, possibly in the dumbest way possible. It's a terminal emulator for Lua, written in Rust. It's not intended to be a serious project, but I'm hoping it'll be a fun one.

Makes use of the [rlua](https://github.com/amethyst/rlua) crate for interfacing with Lua.
